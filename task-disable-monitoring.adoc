If you no longer want to monitor Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can disable the Monitoring service at any time.

If you disable monitoring from each of your working environments, you'll need to delete the virtual machine instance yourself. The instance is named _AcquisitionUnit_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _AcquisitionUnit-FAN7FqeH_

. Select a working environment.
