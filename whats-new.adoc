=== Change to Acquisition Unit name

We changed the default name of the Acquisition Unit instance to CloudInsights-AU-_UUID_ so that the name is more descriptive (the UUID is a generated hash).

You can now enable the Monitoring service on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment even if you have an existing Cloud Insights tenant.
