Complete a few steps to start monitoring Cloud Volumes ONTAP performance.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration.

Supported Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions::
Any version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or in Azure.

Supported Connector::
* For AWS, you need a Connector running version 3.8.4 or later.
* For Azure, you need a Connector running version 3.9.3 or later.

TIP: You can view a Connector's version by clicking the image:screenshot_help_icon.gif[A screenshot of the help icon in the top right of Cloud Manager] icon and then *Support > Connector*.

Email address for Cloud Central::
The email address for your Cloud Central user account should be your business email address. Free email domains like gmail and hotmail aren't supported when creating a Cloud Insights tenant.

Networking for the Acquisition Unit::
The Acquisition Unit uses 2-way/mutual authentication to connect to the Cloud Insights server. The client certificate must be passed to the Cloud Insights server to be authenticated. To accomplish this, the proxy must be set up to forward the http request to the Cloud Insights server without decrypting the data.
+
The Acquisition Unit uses the following two endpoints to communicate with Cloud Insights. If you have a firewall between the Acquisition Unit server and Cloud Insights, you need these endpoints when configuring firewall rules:
+
 https://aulogin.<Cloud Insights Domain>
 https://<your-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>
+
For example:

 https://aulogin.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
 https://cg0c586a-ee05-45rb-a5ac-333b5ae7718d7.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
+
Contact us through the in-product chat if you need help identifying your Cloud Insights domain and tenant ID.

Networking for the Connector::
Similar to the Acquisition Unit, the Connector must have outbound connectivity to the Cloud Insights tenant. But the endpoint that the Connector contacts is slightly different. It contacts the tenant host URL using the shortened tenant ID:
+
 https://<your-short-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>
+
For example:
+
 https://abcd12345.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
+
Again, you can contact us through the in-product chat if you need help identifying the tenant host URL.
